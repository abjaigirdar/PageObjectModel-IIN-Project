# PageObjectModel-IIN-Project #

Hi there :wave: <br>
Have a look at my effort where I implemented the <b> Page Object Model (POM) to test the website using Selenium. </b> 
<br>
I used :pill: <i><b> Integrative Neutrion Inc's </b></i> website in this project.
<br><br>
I followed all the best practices of the POM to achieve a fluent interface and
<br>
kept the project as user-friendly and easy-to-understand as possible.
<br><br>
Feel free to clone it.
<br>
If you have any question regarding this project, ask away.
<br>
I appreciate your feedback.
