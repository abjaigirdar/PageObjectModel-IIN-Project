# PageObjectModel-IIN-Project #

Hi there :wave: <br>
Have a look at our effort to implement the <b> Page Object Model. </b> 
<br>
We used :pill: <i><b> Integrative Neutrion Inc </b></i> website in this project.
<br><br>
We tried our best to stick to the best practices of the POM to acheve the fluent interface and
<br>
keep the project as user-friendly and easy-to-understand as possible.
<br><br>
Feel free to clone it.
<br>
If you have any question regarding this project, ask away.
<br>
We appreciate your feedback.
